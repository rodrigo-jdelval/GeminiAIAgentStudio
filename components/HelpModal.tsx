              <h4>1. Overview</h4>
              <p>The Gemini AI Agent Studio is a powerful, web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for creating, managing, and testing sophisticated AI agents and complex, non-linear multi-agent workflows (pipelines). It enables users to prototype and build agents based on advanced patterns like ReAct, equip them with tools, fine-tune model configurations, and orchestrate them in a visual graph editor. The application must support asynchronous, background execution of tasks.</p>

              <h4>2. Core Features</h4>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Agent Management:</strong> Create, edit, duplicate, and delete agents. Includes predefined examples.</li>
                  <li><strong>AI-Powered Creation:</strong> Generate complete agent or pipeline configurations from a natural language description.</li>
                  <li><strong>Advanced Agent Configuration:</strong> A comprehensive UI to configure agent properties including name, description, system prompt, tools, and fine-tuned model settings (model, temperature, max output tokens).</li>
                  <li><strong>Graphical Pipeline Editor (Graph-Based):</strong> A node-based canvas UI to visually design workflows as directed graphs. It must support complex topologies, including one-to-many and many-to-one data flows.</li>
                  <li><strong>Asynchronous Execution Engine:</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>All agent and pipeline executions must run in the background, allowing the user to navigate the application freely without interrupting active tasks.</li>
                      <li>The sidebar must display a visual indicator (e.g., a spinner) next to any agent or pipeline that is currently running.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Agent & Pipeline Playground:</strong> An interactive environment for testing:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Displays the step-by-step reasoning process (Thought, Action, Observation).</li>
                      <li>Includes an "Stop Execution" button to safely cancel ongoing tasks.</li>
                      <li>Features a robust Markdown renderer capable of displaying headers, lists, tables, and images.</li>
                      <li>Allows toggling between formatted Markdown and raw text views for outputs.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Global Configuration Management:</strong> Import and export the entire application state (all agents and pipelines) as a single JSON file.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>3. Technical Implementation & Architecture</h4>
              
              <h5>Centralized Execution State</h5>
              <p>The application's state management must include a centralized record (e.g., a JavaScript object or map) to track the status and history of all executions. This state is critical for background processing and rehydrating the playground view when the user navigates back to an active or completed task.</p>
              
              <h5>Asynchronous Task Management</h5>
              <p>Each agent or pipeline execution should be managed via an `AbortController` to allow for cancellation. The execution logic must be decoupled from the UI components to run independently.</p>
              
              <h5>Option A: Standalone Client-Side Application (Current Architecture)</h5>
              <p>Designed for simplicity and rapid prototyping without a dedicated backend.</p>
              <pre><code>
- Framework: React with TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect). A centralized execution state object is managed in the root App component.
- Persistence: Browser's localStorage
- API Calls: The @google/genai SDK is used directly from the client.
              </code></pre>

              <h5>Option B: Scalable Client/Server Application with Firebase</h5>
              <p>Designed for production use, offering scalability, security, and multi-user support.</p>
              <pre><code>
- Frontend: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Backend (Serverless): Firebase Functions handle all Gemini API interactions and tool executions securely. The API key is stored server-side.
- Database: Firestore for persistent storage of agents, pipelines, and user data.
- Real-time Updates: Firestore's real-time capabilities can be used to stream execution state updates from the backend to the client.
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication for user management.
              </code></pre>
              
              <h4>4. Pipeline Engine Specification</h4>
              
              <h5>Graph-Based Structure & Execution</h5>
              <p>The pipeline's structure must be stored as a directed graph (`nodes` and `edges`). The execution engine must perform a topological sort to determine the correct, dependency-aware execution order. For nodes with multiple parents, all parent outputs must be aggregated into a single, formatted input for the child node.</p>

              <h4>5. Predefined Content</h4>
              <p>The application must ship with pre-configured agents and pipelines.</p>
              <h6>Key Predefined Agents</h6>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Ransomware Threat Assessor (JSON):</strong> Identifies ransomware threats for a company profile and outputs findings in a structured JSON format.</li>
                  <li><strong>MITRE ATT&CK TTPs Identifier (JSON):</strong> Takes threat actor names and identifies their TTPs, outputting in JSON.</li>
                  <li><strong>Data Visualizer:</strong> An advanced utility agent that formats structured data into human-readable Markdown. It must be capable of generating summaries, tables, lists, and rendering images from URLs found in the input data.</li>
              </ul>
              <h6>Key Predefined Pipeline</h6>
